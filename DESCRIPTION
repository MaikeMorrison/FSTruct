Description: An Fst-based tool to quantify and compare the variability in Q matrices that contain 
    rows of individual membership coefficient vectors (the default output of population 
    structure inference programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE). Included functions simulate random Q matrices,
    plot Q matrices using ggplot2, calculate Fst/FstMax (a
    normalized measure of variability) for a Q matrix, and generate 
    bootstrap replicates of one or more Q matrices along with associated statistics.
