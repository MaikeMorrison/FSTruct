Description: An $F_{ST}$-based tool to compare variability between $Q$ matrices with 
    rows of individual ancestry coefficients (the default output of population 
    structure inference programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE). Included functions
    plot $Q$ matrices using ggplot2, calculate $F_{ST}/F_{ST}^\text{max}$ (a
    normalized measure of variability) for a $Q$ matrix, and generate 
    bootstrap replicates of one or more $Q$ matrices along with associated statistics.
