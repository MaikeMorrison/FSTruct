Description: An Fst-based tool to quantify and compare the variability in Q matrices that contain rows of individual membership coefficient vectors (the default output of population structure inference programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE). Included functions simulate random Q matrices, plot Q matrices using ggplot2, calculate Fst/FstMax (a normalized measure of variability) for a Q matrix, and generate bootstrap replicates of one or more Q matrices along with associated statistics. This package accompanies the paper ''FSTruct: an FST-based tool for measuring ancestry variation in inference of population structure'' by Maike Morrison, Nicolas Alcala, and Noah Rosenberg.
