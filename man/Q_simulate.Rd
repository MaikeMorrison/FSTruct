\title{Simulate one or more Q matrices using the Dirichlet distribution}
\usage{
Q_simulate(alpha, lambda, popsize, rep = 1, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{A number greater than 0 that sets the variability of the membership coefficients under the Dirichlet model. The variance of coefficient k is \eqn{Var[x_k] = \lambda_k(1-\lambda_k)/(\alpha+1)}. Larger values of \eqn{\alpha} lead to lower variability. \code{alpha} can also be a numeric vector, in which case \code{rep} groups of \code{popsize} rows are simulated for each entry of \code{alpha}.}

\item{lambda}{A vector that sets the mean membership of each ancestral cluster across the population. The vector must sum to 1.}

\item{popsize}{The number of individuals to include in each population.}

\item{rep}{The number of populations to generate. Default is 1.}

\item{seed}{Optional; sets the random seed. Use if reproducibility of random results is desired.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the simulated ancestry vectors. Each row represents a single simulated individual. The data frame has the following columns
\itemize{
\item \code{rep}: Which population the row belongs to (a number between 1 and the parameter \code{rep})
\item \code{ind}: Which individual in each population the row corresponds to (a number between 1 and the parameter \code{popsize})
\item \code{alpha}: The alpha value used for that population.
\item \code{Pop}: alpha_rep (where rep and alpha are the first and third columns as described in this list). Serves as a unique identifier for each population.
\item \code{spacer}: a repeated ":" to make simulated Q matrices match output of population structure inference software.
\item \code{q1, q2, etc.}: Membership coefficients (sum to 1).
}
}
\description{
Simulates Q matrices by drawing vectors of membership coefficients from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by two variables: \eqn{\alpha}, which controls variability, and \eqn{\lambda=(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ...., \lambda_K)} which controls the mean of each of the K ancestry coefficients.

\examples{
# Simulate ancestry for 100 random populations of 50 individuals.
# In this example, each Q matrix has
# 100 individuals.
# On average these individuals have
# mean ancestry (1/2, 1/4, 1/4)
# from each of 3 ancestral clusters.
# The variance of each cluster i is
# Var[q_i] = lambda_i(1-lambda_i)/(alpha + 1)
# Here lambda_1 = 1/2,
#      lambda_2 = lambda_3 = 1/4

Q <- Q_simulate(
  alpha = 1,
  lambda = c(1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 4),
  rep = 100,
  popsize = 50,
  seed = 1
)
